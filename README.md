Overview:

Welcome to the Automated Water Analysis System repository! This project aims to revolutionize the water analysis process at drinking water treatment companies by digitizing and automating manual tasks. This README file provides an overview of the system.

Features:

1. Electronic Data Input: Chemists can input experiment results electronically, eliminating the need for manual recording.
2. Automatic Report Generation: The system generates daily reports automatically, providing timely access to critical data for water quality control.
3. Streamlined Communication: Improved communication between the laboratory and water treatment engineers, reducing delays in accessing essential data.


Usage:

1. Chemist Interface:
 . Log in with your credentials.
 . Input experiment results electronically.
 . Access historical data and generate reports.
2. Water Treatment Engineer Interface:
 . Log in with your credentials.
 . Access real-time water quality data.
 . Receive automated reports for quality control.
 . Send notes 
3. Administrative Tasks:
 . Admins can manage user accounts and system settings.
